# Service Parameters
All the Render Engine Service calls make use of a common set of parameters.

These parameters can be logically grouped together.  The models are those groupings, and each grouping is given its own interface.

Theory: It should be possible to use a common input form based on these groupings, turning on/off parts of it based on if the model implements said grouping.
